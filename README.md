# winter camp day1

This is my very first web design project, created on **January 18, 2025**, during a winter camp when I was in **Grade 10 (High School)**.

👩 I'm a student from **Kaohsiung Municipal Kaohsiung Girls' Senior High School (KGHS)**  
🧑‍💻 This was a Day 1 exercise during the web development winter camp  
🎯 It may be a simple page, but it marks my first step into the world of web design and front-end development!
